    <i> “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”

   <p class="p">From the Chapter ,"My mother's" life,  I get a mixture of bad decisisons and the outcome of it all I get aspects of violence and amale chauvinism I get Information on the difference between 
       women in mordern days and those during the traditional days and also the diference in traditions and culture.According to my understanding it was this differences that led to the 
    failure of Patricia a.k.a Mbuyi and Abel a.k.a. Abie. The marriage is done formaly ,not it church though,few people are involved 
 </p> 
 <p class="p">    When are first introduced to Abel , Trevor and his mom find him fun and he is described as charming and helpful.
     He sweeps Patricia off her feet and sooner than expected Trevor starts noticing they were visiting the  garage more often but all this doesnt make sence to him
    at the age of seven.Abel and Patricia get even closer and hang out more this doesnt bother Trevor as Abel wasnt acting like his father .I would compare this to real life situtations whether
people pretend or ake who they are and in no time their true self is reveiled    </p>
  <p class="p">Abel was raised in a partriachal soiciety ,he was used to women being submissive and they   were not equal  in anyway.
    he is the bread winner and is used to making decisions around his home along side his brother .in his community women bow when greeeting 
men .Patricia is educated and in no way what other wives are in Tzaneen.I've had so many debates on morderd days marriages being compared to traditional ones
 .The topic is a tough one ,though as human being we will never have the same opinion.   </p>


 <p class="p"> I am neither a feminist nor a male chauver I highly believe in equality for all ,going through this chapter I had a challenge I denifying what might have been the root cayuse for Abel's behaviour and what might have been the best way for Patricia to handle the whole situation as a victim of violence.
     Personally I think Patricia is  a strong woman ,she is bold unlike the women Abel grew around.Abel tries to lock her in a cage but she 
    ,being the free spirit she is ,still goes out and attends church.I see this a lot in our community ,with education coming in these days women now have a sence of identity and end up following what they feel is right .
    If I had a chance to be in Patricia's life at that time I would have pushed her until she walked away. 
    though it's easier said than done, those who are brave enough to walk out of an abusive marriage or relationship always end up
    safe and in no time happy because they get time to heal and work on themselves.
   

 </p>


 <p class="p">
     Abel's toxic masculinity makes him turn to abusing drugs, he goes home late and sometimes doesnt even show up.
     He insists that Patricia who is a Xhosa doesnt respect him.Xhosas were nothing compared to the Tzaneens. Xhosas women are know for being loud and 
     mouthy as stated in the memior yet Abel still chose Patricia .In my opinion he wasnt ready to move in with her ,the whole marriage was push and their relationship shouldnt have 
     gone past courting .He goes to the extent of hitting Patricia when his temper goes beyond control.Patricia may have provoked him but he had not right to do that, not at at all.

   <h1> The Overall Use Of Humour And How Trevor Noah Uses It In Times Of  Trouble And Darkness  .   </h1>
  
      <p class="p">
          
        
        In the memior, the Author narrates  his life as a multi-racial citizen,thoughout his life we get instances of humour in the most unexpected 
          moments in his life.He uses a humourous tone to pass messages of the most traumatic events of his life during narration.
          Below are some of the instances depicting humour .
          I would recommend this book to everyone :)
      </p>

      <p class="p">. 
    after the kidnapping incident Trevor Noah tells his mom that she should have paid attention to God's Signs ,he says that God was informing then not to leave the house but 
    to stay at home since the day would have turned out as it did.He tells his mom that they should invite God to their house next time since he can not risk being kidnapped again
       </p><br>



       <p class="p"> Second,Trevoh Noah gets hungry during Mass and being the foody he is he falls into temptation and eats the sacramentals .
           when he is questioned he responds by asking why he says he doesnt understand why the sacramentals were set aside 
        for Catholics yet Jesus had it despite the fact that he was Jewish.On my opinion this shows Trevor's innoscence and humour he doesnt understand 
    why the church works in that way . </p>
<p class="p"> Third,when his mom is shot,which was one of the darkest moments in his life,humour helped his family heal .Patricia cracks a joke ,in my opinion, to stop Trevor from crying.
    She makes fun of how her nose looks and tells Trevor to look on the bright side and makes a compliment saying " ...atleast now  because of my nose , you are officially the
    best-looking person in the family"      </p>
<p class="p"> Fourth, when he goes to (school) he surprises all students with his ability to speak almost all languages 
    his friend introduces him to the rest of the students who keep asking him to share his trick with them.This w
  this ability helped him twice during this scenerio and also when two guys wanted to mug him he shocks them with his response 
since they though he was of  the white race and wouldnt understand their plans.They laugh and dissolve their plans </p>
    
<p class="p"> Fifth,Trevor takes advantage of his new timberlands and ofcourse,his humour,to act as an american 
    rapper in order to get his friend out of trouble </p>

    <p class="p">Lastly ,there is an instance of humour in total akwardness, Trevor Noah gives us a vivid description of how the their toilet looked and describes an uncomfortable enviroment
        and the heavy rain .He describes sarcasticaly yet vulnerably , how the toilet  full of flies and his fear of them attacking him,
          way he decideds to poop on a paper,at this point he is completely unaware that his grandmother is around
         he hides from her as she notices a bad smell and starts asking whether there is someone in the house
        .later on he is asked to pray in front of his neighbours as they thought a with was respondible for that action. 
<p class="p"> To conclude, in my opinion,the use of humour in the parts I have mentioned engaged me as reader and even though
    some parts of the book are quite emotional there is a balance and most of the time if not in all cases he elicited joyful emotions 
 when reading moments of trauma,racism,violence.This to me is important since there are readers who have gone through such experiences 
or even worse, but reading the book does not make them revive how they felt during such experiences.
Ive leart that it's those experiences that shape us.      </p>
